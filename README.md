# Tesla OAuth Token Generation
A script on how to interact with the recent OAuth2 changes from Tesla and the new `/oauth2/` endpoint. It was open sources so we could let other people in the community better understand the flow of how secrets were passed around in a token exchange.

## How to run
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed
- Make sure you have chromedrier installed
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the script while passing in email and password along with a token file (not required)
- If account has MFA enabled you need to pass `--passcode UNUSED_PASSCODE` (passcode generated by your authenticator app) or `--backup_passcode PASSCODE` (one of your unused backup passcodes)
- Tesla supports up to 2 authenticator devices. By default script uses 1st device. You can pass `--device 2` to use 2nd device.

```
